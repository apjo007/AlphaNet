# AlphaNet - AI Driven Network Monitoring System

## Overview

AlphaNet is a Human-in-the-loop based network monitoring and incident analysis platform.

The current PoC consists of:

- GNS3 based MPLS network simulation
- Python telemetry collector
- FastAPI telemetry ingestion layer
- AI analysis pipeline

The objective is to monitor network health, detect failures, and provide automated root cause analysis.

# Routing Validation

The following communication has been tested:


PC1 → PC2

PC2 → PC1


Successful bidirectional communication confirms:

- CE routing
- PE forwarding
- Core router forwarding
- End-to-end MPLS path availability

Note

Cisco Packet Tracer is currently used for MPLS topology validation.
For production-grade telemetry collection, integration with:
SNMP
GNS3/EVE-NG
Real network devices
can be added.
